## About Me

- 🌍 Based in London
- 📊 Recently completed a data analysis bootcamp
- 💼 Currently working on a project that tracks and analyzes the sentiments of stocks on social media and news, comparing it to stock performance to find correlations

## Current Project

### Gini Coefficient vs Political Polarisation

I'm currently working on a project that aims to analyse how income inequality and political polarisation correlate. The project will specifically analyse OECD countries to see if income inequality is associated with a rise in political polarisation within these developed democracies.

Income inequality has been a growing concern across developed nations, leading to debates about its wider impact on society. This project will explore whether income inequality may contribute to the fragmentation of political consensus and the rise of ideological extremism. 

### Key Components

- Data Collection: Gathering data from the World Inequality Database (for Gini statistics) and the Manifesto Project (for ideological polarisation statistics), as well as the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (for deeper polarisation statistics).
- Data Processing: Utilizing `pandas`, `numpy`, and `statsmodels` for data manipulation and analysis respectively.
- Data Visualization: Creating visual representations using PowerBI to understand and view trends and correlations.

## Skills

- Data Analysis
- PowerBI
- Python (pandas, numpy, nltk, statsmodels, and more)
- SQL
