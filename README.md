## About Me

- 🌍 Based in London

- 💡 Actively seeking opportunities to contribute to data-driven projects!


## Current Project

### Gini Coefficient vs Political Polarisation

I'm currently working on a project that aims to analyse how income inequality and political polarisation correlate. The project will specifically analyse OECD countries to see if income inequality is associated with a rise in political polarisation within these developed democracies.

Income inequality has been a growing concern across developed nations, leading to debates about its wider impact on society. This project will explore whether income inequality may contribute to the fragmentation of political consensus and the rise of ideological extremism. 

### Key Components

- Data Collection: Gathering and merging data from the Manifesto Project Dataset (version 2024a) for party-level ideological positions (rile scores) and electoral performance (pervote), and economic indicators (GINI coefficient and CPI) from OECD datasets.
- Data Processing: Utilizing `pandas`, `numpy`, and `statsmodels` for data cleaning and transformation; and correlation and regression analysis respectively.
- Data Visualization: Using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for initial visualisations in Python. Creating visual representations using PowerBI to understand and view trends and correlations.
